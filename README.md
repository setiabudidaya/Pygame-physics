# Pendulums with Pygame

This project provides a pendulum class and an example of how instances of this class can be used to simulate a Netwon's cradle in with pygame.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Install and run

Assuming you have python 2.7.x and pip package manager already set up on your machine, you can simply run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or, seeing as you pygame is the only requirement, you could install it in your preferred method.

Once the required packages are installed, run the newtons cradle simulation and try iy out!
```
python multiplePendulums.py

All tests for this application are confined to a single file. To run them
